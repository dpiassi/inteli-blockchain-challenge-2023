# STABLESHOP • Buy Gift Cards using BTGUSD

-- TODO embed demo video here

## Abstract

This project aims to improve the usability of the stablecoin [BTG Dol (BTGUSD)](mynt.com.br/btgdol) by allowing any customer with a [BTGUSD](https://polygonscan.com/token/0xdd570174ff93c7282614710baa0ca07ec1b1db45) tokens to purchase from a wide variety of digital stores from all around the world.

## Minimum viable product

> Using crypto wallets as gift cards improves accessibility, liquidity, and fosters a thriving ecosystem for BTG Dol.

The MVP uses a prepaid card structure called *gift card* to empower the use of **BTG Dol** in digital stores. With this solution, customers who wish to use **BTG Dol** on their daily purchases will be able to. This solution provides a convenient and affordable way for users to take advantage of **BTG Dol** in the context of everyday transactions.

## Technologies

We choose [Remix](https://remix.run/) as the full stack development framework in order to speed up the process of writing both front-end and back-end logic. The MVP was built from scratch using a Remix template called [Indie](https://github.com/remix-run/indie-stack). The stack of this template includes some frameworks and solutions such as: React, SQLite Database, Prisma, Tailwind, Cypress, Vitest, and more.

The library [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.9.0/) is used to trigger and listen to updates on Ethereum blockchain. It integrates seamlessly with MetaMask wallet, both on mobile apps and web browsers.

Finally, the REST API that allows us to order Gift Cards from all around the world is [reloadly Gift Cards API](https://docs.reloadly.com/gift-cards/Products/Get-Products). It's important to state that everything that was built and validated so far happened under Test environments.

## Benefits

### Convenience

### Security
The use of the *gift card* prepaid card provides an additional layer of security. Users do not need to provide sensitive information such as credit card or bank account details during the purchase process. This reduces the risk of exposure to fraud or data theft.

### Accessibility
By providing a prepaid card solution, the project makes **BTG Dol** more accessible to a wider audience. Not all users have access to bank accounts or credit cards, but they can easily acquire a prepaid *gift card* to use BTG Dol in their daily transactions.

### Expense control
The *gift card* prepaid card allows users to better control their spending with BTG Dol. They can load the desired balance on the card, thus limiting the available amount for purchases. This can be useful to avoid overspending or closely monitor real-time expenses.

### Expansion of BTG Dol usage
By offering a practical and easy-to-use payment solution for daily transactions, the project helps promote the adoption and usage of BTG Dol as a digital currency. This can drive the economy surrounding BTG Dol and increase opportunities for users to enjoy the benefits of this cryptocurrency.
